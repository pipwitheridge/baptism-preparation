        <p>Baptism is a wonderful gift from God. We want to help those preparing for baptism to understand what baptism is, what a standard Anglican baptism service involves, how to share their testimony (if they choose to), and some other important things to keep in mind.</p>

        <h2 id="whatIsBaptism">What is baptism?</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Baptism is a symbol or a sign that points to God's power to save. It symbolises God's power to wash away our sin. Going down into the water symbolises us dying to our old way of life, and coming out of the water symbolises us rising to new life in Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we are not justified by baptism (we are justified by faith alone), it is still important! In a similar way that love and prayer are vital parts of following Jesus, so is participating in the signs that Jesus gives to his disciples. We celebrate the Lord's Supper for a similar reason—not because it saves, but because our saviour gave it to us as a symbol to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>Jesus commanded his disciples to make disciples, teaching them and baptising them. Through the New Testament and church history, baptism is a sign for disciples of Jesus.</p>
            <p>Throughout church history and within the Anglican Church, Christians baptise all those they consider part of God's family—infants included. In the Old Testament, God rescues both adults and infants, bringing them out of slavery into freedom. God does the same thing through Christ in the New Testament.</p>
            <p>
                When we bring a child for baptism we are asking that God in his time will enable the child to turn and trust in Christ, in response to his call and promise in the gospel.
                This prayer is accompanied by the declaration of sponsors, as they respond to God’s call on behalf of the child.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sponsors who bring children to baptism take on the responsibility to bring them up to live the Christian life and come to mature Christian belief.
                When children are old enough to answer for themselves, the service of Confirmation enables them publicly to reaffirm the promises made on their behalf at their baptism and be prayed for to receive strength from the Holy Spirit to persevere and grow in Christ.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="baptismService">What does a baptism service involve?</h2>
            <p><i>Below is the layout of a typical Anglican baptism service. This can change slightly in different contexts, depending on things like whether a baptism tank is used, if/when testimonies are shared, and so on. The bits in <span class="red">red</span> are not said by anyone, the bits in normal text are said by the minister, and the bits in <b>bold</b> are said by those being baptised and/or by the congregation.</i></p>
            <p class="red">1. The minister welcomes those who have come for baptism and addresses the congregation. The passages of Scripture may be read in the indicated places.</p>
            <p>
                Without Christ, we humans are far gone from God and mired in sin.
                But through the gospel, God addresses each one of us and calls us back to himself, resulting in a profound change.
                The act of baptism is about that change.
            </p>
            <p>
                We follow the direction of Jesus, who said, ‘Go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.’
                <p>Ordinary water is used to point to the extraordinary work of God in cleansing us from sin and giving us a new heart to trust and serve him, through the death and resurrection of his Son.</p>
                <p>Baptism provides a public opportunity to turn to Christ and express a personal trust in him and what he has done for us and ask for the renewing work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                <p>As the apostle Peter said, ‘Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.'</p>
                <p>So let us thank God for drawing these people to himself, hear their profession of repentance, faith and commitment to Christ, and pray for the work of the Holy Spirit in their lives.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="red">2. The congregation joins the minister in praying,</p>
            <p class="bold">
                Heavenly Father, <br>
                we thank you that in your great love <br>
                you have called us to know you <br>
                and to trust you. <br>
                Increase this knowledge and strengthen our faith.<br>
                Grant these people what they cannot have by nature <br>
                that being born again by the Holy Spirit, <br>
                they may be cleansed from all sin, <br>
                and inherit your eternal kingdom; <br>
                through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
            </p>
            <p class="red">
                3. If the baptism does not take place within the context of another service, suitable passages from Scripture should be read and a sermon given at this point.
            </p>
            <div class="red">4. The minister invites those who are to be baptised to stand and says to them,</div>
            <p>
                Those who are to be baptised must declare their allegiance to Christ and their rejection of all that is evil: the devil and all his works, the empty display and false values of the world, and the sinful desires of the flesh. Therefore I ask you,
                <p>
                    Do you turn to Christ? <br>
                    <b>I turn to Christ.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you repent of your sins? <br>
                    <b>I repent of my sins.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you reject selfish living and all that is false and unjust? <br>
                    <b>I reject them all.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you renounce Satan and all evil? <br>
                    <b>I renounce all that is evil.</b>
                </p>
                <p>Almighty God deliver you from the powers of darkness, and lead you in the light of Christ to his everlasting kingdom. <b>Amen.</b></p>
            </p>
            <div class="red">5. The candidates may be given an opportunity to testify to the way they have come to faith in Christ. The minister then says,</div>
            <p>
            You have come here to be baptised. I ask you now to affirm the Christian faith as yours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you believe in God the Father? <br>
                <b>I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you believe in God the Son? <br>
                <b>I believe in Jesus Christ, God’s only Son, our Lord, <br>
                who was conceived of the Holy Spirit, <br>
                born of the virgin Mary, <br>
                suffered under Pontius Pilate, <br>
                was crucified, died, and was buried; <br>
                he descended to the dead. <br>
                On the third day he rose again from the dead; <br>
                he ascended into heaven, <br>
                and is seated at the right hand of the Father; <br>
                from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you believe in God the Holy Spirit? <br>
                <b>I believe in the Holy Spirit, <br>
                the holy catholic church, <br>
                the communion of saints, <br>
                the forgiveness of sins, <br>
                the resurrection of the body, <br>
                and the life everlasting. <br>
                Amen.</b>
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
            <p class="red">The minister says to the congregation,</p>
            <p>This is the faith of the Church.</p>
            <p class="red">The congregation responds,</p>
            <p class="bold">This is our faith: we believe in one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="red">6. The minister says to the candidates for baptism, </p>
            <p>
                Will you follow Jesus faithfully, and obey his commands throughout your life? <br>
                <b>With God’s help, I intend to do so.</b> <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you ask for baptism in the faith you have professed? <br>
                <b>I do.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="red">7. Standing at the font with the candidates and their sponsors, the minister says,</p>
            <p>Let us pray.</p>
            <p>
                Merciful God, for Jesus Christ’s sake, grant that these people, whom we baptise in this water, may be saved through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.
                May they die to sin and rise again to righteousness.
                May your Spirit live and work in them, and may they be yours forever, through Jesus Christ our Lord, who died and rose again for us. <b>Amen.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="red">8. The minister asks each person to come to the font and baptises them by dipping them in the water or pouring water on them, saying</p>
            <p>N, I baptise you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. <b>Amen.</b> </p>
            <p class="red">9. After all the candidates have been baptised the minister and congregation address them.</p>
            <p>God has called you into his church. <br>
            <b>We therefore receive and welcome you as a fellow member of the body of Christ, as a child of the same heavenly Father, and as an inheritor with us of the kingdom of God.</b></p>
            <p class="red">10. The minister makes a sign of the cross on each candidate’s forehead and says,</p>
            <p>
                I sign you with the sign of the cross to show that you are to be true to Christ crucified and that you are not to be ashamed to confess your faith in him. <br>
                <b>Fight bravely under his banner against sin, the world and the devil, and continue Christ’s faithful soldier and servant to your life’s end.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="red">11. The minister continues.</p>
            <p>God has called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. Shine as a light in the world to the glory of God the Father.</p>
            <p class="red">12. The minister continues with this prayer.</p>
            <p>Gracious God, we thank you that through the death and resurrection of your Son, you have brought us from death to life. Enable us by your Spirit to resist the power of sin and give ourselves to you as a living sacrifice. May we not be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our mind, so that we serve and please you in every way. <b>Amen.</b></p>
            <p class="red">13. If it is not used elsewhere in the service, the Lord’s Prayer may be said together here. </p>
            <p class="bold">
                Our Father in heaven, <br>
                hallowed be your name, <br>
                your kingdom come, <br>
                your will be done on earth as in heaven. <br>
                Give us today our daily bread. <br>
                Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. <br>
                Lead us not into temptation, <br>
                but deliver us from evil. <br>
                For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and for ever. <br>
                Amen.
            </p>
            <p class="red">14. The service may conclude with these words.</p>
                The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, <br>
                and the love of God, <br>
                and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit <br>
                be with us all evermore. <br>
                <b>Amen.</b>
        <h2 id="testimony">How do you prepare to share your testimony?</h2>
            <p>
                Sharing your testimony—the story of how God has worked in your life—is a powerful way to encourage other Christians. It helps people remember that God is powerful to save. He changes lives and helps people live life to the full through faith in Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we share our testimony we want it to highlight God's goodness. A testimony, like any good story, typically includes three elements:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>1. The beginning.</b> What was your life like before you knew God?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. The middle.</b> How did you become a Christian? Who were the key people involved, the key moments, and the key Bible passages? In this section is a good opportunity to explain your understanding of the gospel briefly, and how it changed your life.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. The end.</b> What is life like now that you follow Jesus? What does following Jesus mean for you at this stage in your life?
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Note: A typical testimony during a service should go for 2–3 minutes.</i>
            </p>
        <h2 id="otherThings">Other things to remember</h2>
            <p>
                A baptism service is a great opportunity to invite friends and family along. Have a think: who are three people that you could invite to witness your baptism?
            </p>
            <p>
                Baptisms involve water! Make sure to bring anything you'll need. If you are not given a shirt to wear, wear a dark coloured one. Bring a towel and a change of clothes for afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting baptised is a chance to reflect on God's goodness toward you. In the days leading up to the service, take the opportunity to spend time praying and reflecting, giving thanks to God for giving you new life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions! Getting baptised is also a good learning opportunity. Ask any questions you have!
